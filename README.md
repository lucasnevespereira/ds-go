### Linear vs Non-Linear Data Structures

[Source] (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-linear-and-non-linear-data-structures)

#### Linear

A linear data structure is arranged in a sequential manner (following in a logical order). They are easy to implement because computer memory is also sequential.

<i>(e.g.) - List, Queue, Stack, Array etc.</i>

#### Non-Linear

A non-linear data structure is arranged in a non-sequential manner (not following a logical order). An element can have multiple paths to connect to other elements. They are not easy to implement but more efficient.

<i>(e.g.) - Tree, Binary Search Trees, Graphs etc.</i>
